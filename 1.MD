### Description
This challenge tests the competitors ability to bruteforce web login portals.

### Challenge
The competitor accesses the /webchal1 directory and is presented with an authentication screen. The default username presented in the login promp is admin. The competitor then uses a bruteforcing program such as WFuzz or similar to discover the password.

### Flag
_There's a hidden flag in the site_

#### Install Guest Additions _[Optional]_

<br/>

    > :warning:  **If you are using Oracle VirtualBox**: Guest Additions allows you to achieves _near bare-metal_ performance on your Virtual Machine (VM).

<br/>

5. From the _menu bar_ of Oracle VM VirtualBox _click_:          
**Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...**
<br/> to mount a the _Guest Additions_ cd-rom virtually on your Kali virtual machine

6. Next, _click_ on **Cancel** in the subsequent _pop-up_ box:

    ![upgrade](/images/1/4-guest-additions.png)

7. In your previously opened **Terminal** application by typing the following command and _hitting_ **Enter** to change directories into the mounted _guest additions_ cd-rom:
    ```sh
    $ cd /media/cdrom
    ```
8. Make the _VBoxLinuxAdditions.run_ script executable by typing the following command and _hitting_ **Enter**:
    ```sh
    $ chmod +x VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
    ```
        _**Tip:** :bulb: You can just _type_ VBoxL... and then _hit_ **tab** to have the terminal intelligently autocomplete the right file.

9. Execute the bash script by typing the following command and _hitting_ **Enter**:

#### Change the Desktop Environment _[Optional]_

<br/>

> For users that are familiar with the mainstream versions of Linux like Ubuntu by Canonical, it might be helpful to switch over to a GNOME Desktop environment. 

<br/>

10. Type the following command and _hit_ **Enter**. Then select **1** or whatever **Selection** number corresponds to **/usr/bin/gnome-session**:

eos@kali:~$ sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager 
[sudo] password for eos: 
There are 4 choices for the alternative x-session-manager (providing /usr/bin/x-session-manager).

    ```sh
        Selection    Path                      Priority   Status
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    0            /usr/bin/gnome-session     50        auto mode
    * 1            /usr/bin/gnome-session     50        manual mode
    2            /usr/bin/startplasma-x11   40        manual mode
    3            /usr/bin/startxfce4        50        manual mode
    4            /usr/bin/xfce4-session     40        manual mode

    Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 1
    ```

11. To have your changes take effect, shut down your Kali instance by typing the following command and _hitting_ **Enter**:
    ```sh

    ```

#### Configure Shared Folder _[Optional]_

<br/>

> Configuring a shared folder allows you to pass files between your _Host_ machine and _Kali VM_

12. Open up **Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager** on your host machine and _right-click_ on the Kali-Linx VM. _Select_ **Settings** from the drop-down menu bar.

13. In _Settings_, from the left menu-bar, _select_ **Shared Folders** and _click_ on the small blue folder with a green plus sign on it.

14. From the **Add Share** menu that pops open, type in a **Folder Name**, for example _kali-vbox_ and _check_ the **Auto-mount** box. Then _click_ on **OK** as shown below:

    ![upgrade](/images/1/7-host-shared-vbox-manager.png)

15. Double-click on on the Kali-Linx VM to power on Kali. Once booted, _open_ up the white folder icon from the left menu-bar on the Desktop.

    ![upgrade](/images/1/0-open-terminal.png)

16. You will now see a new ejectable drive visible in the left menu bar _(named sf_Kali)_. 
However, when you click on it, it will throw the _This location could not be diplayed error_ as displayed below:

    ![upgrade](/images/1/8-shared-no-access.png)

<br/>


17. Build the brute-force **payload** using **wfuzz** with the following flags:
    * _--hc 403_ _Filters out all the passwords that fail with **403 - HTTP Forbidden Code**_
    * _-d postdata_ _Autofills **admin** as the known username and specifies **password** as the field to **FUZZ** _i.e. iterate on_
    * _-u url_ _The target endpoint that we want to bruteforce_
    * _-w_ _The wordlist we want to use to guess the password with_


> **Tip:** :bulb: We can figure out the exact endpoint to target to specify in our -u flag by doing the following 3 steps:
        18. _Right-click_ on the target web page and click on **View Page Source**

            ![upgrade](/images/1/20-view-pg-src.png)

        19. _Identify_ the hyperlink that the blue "Log In" button corresponds to on **line 41** in the **html code**, _right-click_ on it and select **Inspect Element (Q)**

            ![upgrade](/images/1/21-inspect-element.png)


        20. Find the exact url endpoint inside the _speech marks_ specified as the substring after the _"view-source:"_ prefix in the  **href** tag

            > http://127.0.0.1:3001/1/login 

            ![upgrade](/images/1/22-endpoint.png)
        
21. Execute the payload by typing the following command and _hitting_ **Enter**:
   
    ```sh
    $ wfuzz --hc 403 -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -u http://127.0.0.1:3001/1/login -w /usr/share/wordlists/nmap.ls
    ```
